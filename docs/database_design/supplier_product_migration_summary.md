# Supplier-Product Relationship: Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

**Original Issue:**
When creating a Purchase Order (PO), selecting a supplier did not filter the product list. Users could see and select ALL products, regardless of whether the selected supplier actually provides those products.

**Business Impact:**
- Risk of ordering products from wrong suppliers
- Confusion for users managing many products
- No way to track supplier-specific pricing or terms
- Scalability issues as product catalog grows

## Solution Implemented

**New Database Table:** `supplier_products`

This junction table establishes a many-to-many relationship between suppliers and products.

### Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE supplier_products (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  supplier_id UUID REFERENCES suppliers(id),
  product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),

  -- Business data
  supplier_product_code TEXT,
  unit_price DECIMAL(12, 2),
  lead_time_days INTEGER,
  minimum_order_qty INTEGER,
  is_primary_supplier BOOLEAN,
  is_active BOOLEAN,

  UNIQUE(supplier_id, product_id)
);
```

### Key Features

1. **Many-to-Many Support**
   - One supplier → Multiple products
   - One product → Multiple suppliers (alternative suppliers)

2. **Supplier-Specific Data**
   - Price (each supplier may have different prices)
   - Lead time (delivery time varies by supplier)
   - Minimum order quantity (MOQ)
   - Primary supplier flag (preferred supplier)
   - Active status (can currently order from this supplier)

3. **Data Example from Seed Data**

```
Seoul Beauty Co.
├── Hyaluronic Acid Serum (₩25,000, 7 days, MOQ: 100) ✓ Primary
├── Vitamin C Cream (₩35,000, 7 days, MOQ: 100) ✓ Primary
└── Snail Mucin Mask (₩15,000, 7 days, MOQ: 100) ✓ Primary

Busan Marine
├── Hyaluronic Acid Serum (₩26,000, 7 days, MOQ: 150) ✗ Alternative
└── Snail Mucin Mask (₩14,500, 7 days, MOQ: 150) ✗ Alternative
```

**Note:** "Hyaluronic Acid Serum" has 2 suppliers (price comparison possible)

## Files Changed/Created

### 1. New Migration File
**File:** `supabase/migrations/011_create_supplier_products_table.sql`

Creates the `supplier_products` table with:
- Foreign key constraints
- Unique constraint (supplier_id, product_id)
- Indexes for performance
- RLS policies for security
- Trigger for `updated_at` timestamp

### 2. Updated Seed Data
**File:** `supabase/seed_data.sql`

Added section 3: Supplier-Product relationships
- Seoul Beauty: 7 skincare products
- Jeju Natural: 4 natural/body products (2 as alternative suppliers)
- K-Beauty Labs: 4 makeup products
- Busan Marine: 2 products (all as alternative suppliers)
- Hanbok Herbal: 2 haircare products

**Total:** 19 supplier-product relationships across 15 products and 5 suppliers

### 3. Documentation
**File:** `docs/database_design/supplier_products_relationship.md`

Comprehensive guide covering:
- Problem statement and solution
- Database schema design
- API implementation examples
- Frontend implementation patterns
- SQL query examples
- Future enhancements

### 4. Updated Project Instructions
**File:** `CLAUDE.md`

Updated sections:
- Core Tables: 10 → 11 tables (added `supplier_products`)
- New section: Supplier-Product Relationship explanation
- Updated Key Business Workflows (PO creation flow)
- Updated API Design Patterns (new endpoints)

## Implementation Impact

### Backend Changes Needed

1. **New API Endpoints**
   ```
   GET  /api/v1/suppliers/:id/products       (get products for supplier)
   GET  /api/v1/products/:id/suppliers       (get suppliers for product)
   POST /api/v1/supplier-products            (create relationship)
   PUT  /api/v1/supplier-products/:id        (update relationship)
   DELETE /api/v1/supplier-products/:id      (remove relationship)
   ```

2. **Modified Endpoints**
   ```
   POST /api/v1/purchase-orders
   - Add validation: check products belong to selected supplier
   - Auto-fill unit prices from supplier_products table
   ```

### Frontend Changes Needed

1. **Purchase Order Creation Form**
   - Step 1: Select supplier (dropdown)
   - Step 2: Fetch and display only that supplier's products
   - Step 3: Pre-fill unit price, MOQ, lead time from supplier_products
   - Validation: Prevent selecting products not from chosen supplier

2. **Product Management**
   - New tab: "Suppliers" for each product
   - Show all suppliers who provide this product
   - Display price comparison table
   - Mark primary supplier

3. **Supplier Management**
   - New tab: "Products" for each supplier
   - List all products this supplier provides
   - Ability to add/remove products
   - Edit supplier-specific pricing and terms

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Run Migration
```bash
# Apply new migration
supabase migration up
# or run SQL directly in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### Step 2: Seed Relationships
```bash
# Run updated seed_data.sql
# This populates supplier_products table
```

### Step 3: Update Backend
- Implement new API endpoints
- Add validation to PO creation
- Update PO form to fetch filtered products

### Step 4: Update Frontend
- Modify PO creation form (supplier selection → product filtering)
- Add supplier-product management UIs
- Update product/supplier detail pages

### Step 5: Test
- Create PO, verify only supplier's products shown
- Try to manually add product from different supplier (should fail)
- Test price auto-fill from supplier_products
- Verify MOQ warnings work

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration runs successfully
- [ ] Seed data inserts 19 supplier-product relationships
- [ ] Can query `supplier_products` table
- [ ] API endpoint `/suppliers/:id/products` returns filtered list
- [ ] PO creation shows only supplier's products
- [ ] Unit prices pre-fill from supplier_products
- [ ] Cannot add product from different supplier
- [ ] Can view all suppliers for a product (price comparison)
- [ ] Primary supplier badge displays correctly
- [ ] Alternative suppliers show as secondary options

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Data Integrity
✅ Cannot accidentally order products from wrong supplier
✅ Clear audit trail of supplier-product relationships
✅ Enforced constraints at database level

### 2. User Experience
✅ Reduced confusion (only see relevant products)
✅ Faster data entry (prices pre-filled)
✅ Better decision-making (MOQ, lead time visible upfront)

### 3. Business Logic
✅ Price comparison between suppliers
✅ Alternative supplier management
✅ Supplier performance tracking (future)

### 4. Scalability
✅ Handles thousands of products efficiently
✅ Simple to add/remove products from supplier catalog
✅ Easy to deactivate relationships without deleting data

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
- Supplier performance tracking (delivery rate, quality score)
- Auto-suggest best supplier based on price/lead time/performance
- Price history tracking

### Phase 3
- Supplier contract management
- Automatic price updates from supplier API
- Bulk upload supplier catalogs (Excel)

### Phase 4
- AI-powered supplier recommendations
- Predictive analysis (which supplier will have best delivery time)
- Integration with supplier systems (EDI, API)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is straightforward:

```sql
-- 1. Drop the table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS supplier_products CASCADE;

-- 2. Remove references in application code
-- 3. Revert to previous version of seed_data.sql
-- 4. Revert CLAUDE.md changes
```

**Note:** No data loss risk as this is a new table. Existing data (suppliers, products, POs) remains unchanged.

- **Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/011_create_supplier_products_table.sql`
- **Seed Data:** `supabase/seed_data.sql` (section 3)
- **Schema Diagram:** [TBD - recommend creating ERD]

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if we already have purchase orders in the system?**
A: Run a migration script to create supplier-product relationships based on existing POs:
```sql
INSERT INTO supplier_products (supplier_id, product_id, unit_price, is_primary_supplier)
SELECT DISTINCT po.supplier_id, poi.product_id, AVG(poi.unit_price), true
FROM purchase_orders po
JOIN purchase_order_items poi ON po.id = poi.purchase_order_id
GROUP BY po.supplier_id, poi.product_id;
```

**Q: Can a product have no suppliers?**
A: Yes, but you cannot create a PO for it. Consider adding a "discontinued" or "inactive" status to products table.

**Q: Can we have supplier-specific SKUs?**
A: Yes! Use the `supplier_product_code` field. Each supplier can use their own SKU/code.

**Q: How do we handle price changes over time?**
A: MVP: Update `unit_price` directly (no history). Phase 2: Create `supplier_product_price_history` table.

**Q: What about quantity discounts (tiered pricing)?**
A: Post-MVP feature. Add `supplier_product_price_tiers` table with qty_min, qty_max, unit_price.

## Next Steps
